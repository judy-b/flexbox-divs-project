                My name is Judy and I'm a Utah native. I've grown up enjoying the outdoors and falling in love with the mountains. I have been able to study abroad in many places such as the UK, Jordan, Israel, Turkey, and Azerbaijan. As much as I love traveling, there is no place like home.

                Since the time I was seven I've been playing the violin. I have taken lessons for sixteen years and participated in orchestra for thirteen of those years. I have a degree in violin performance and I'll always love playing music, especially with my sisters.

                I got married over two years ago to the love of my life, Andrew. He is from Maryland, loves running, and speaks five languages. I've never met someone more impressive or who I connected with more easily. I'm lucky to have him by my side through all of life!
